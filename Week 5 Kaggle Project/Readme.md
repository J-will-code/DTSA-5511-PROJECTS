Overview

We will use a CycleGANs architecture in this project to convert photos to Monet-style format. 
The dataset is made up of 7,038 photographs and 300 Monet paintings.
Each of these images has 256x256 pixels and three channels of 8-bit red, green, and blue values (i.e. a 24-bit 256x256 image).
